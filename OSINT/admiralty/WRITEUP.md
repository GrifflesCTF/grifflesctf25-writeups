At the top of the chatlog.png, we can see that there is some random jumble of words. Reading it out, we get: venus_vwduexfnv

If we plug it into ROT47 and rotate to 59, we will get SBKRP<STARBUCKS
So now we know that the coffee shop is a Starbucks.

When searching up the words "venus_vwduexfnv", you should come across an Instagram account with the same name. 

Looking at the pictures closely anough, you should be able to identify that this is somewhere in China / Macau / Taipei ( due to the chinese characters in the train picture )

At the same time, there happens to be a MTR Station in Hong Kong called Admiralty which is also on the Red Line!

From then on, simply try the Starbucks near the MTR Station Admiralty and you should get it.
