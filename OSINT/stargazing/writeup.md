Open Stellarium or any other stargazing app and change the date and time to the 08/11/2024, 21:20. Using the azimuth grid, find the zenith and enlarge until you see a star near the zenith (as hinted by the squint word in Astra's message).

This is the Kappa Piscium star, it is a type of rotating variable star. 
From Abyss's message, you are hinted to look at the setting time of the star. In Stellarium, you can find this under the set attribute, giving you 3h25m. 
Add the verification code shn to get 3h25mshn and use ROT decode (as hinted by rotating variable star type) to obtain the flag "wavyflag".
